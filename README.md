I built this template with the idea of a minimal CUDA setup. Just CMake and C++. Feel free to re-use for your own project, its pretty barebones by design.

## How to compile and run the project:

If this is the template C++ file, please copy the entire folder, rename it, and continue.

Note: 
    - Update any mention of "project" in the CMakeLists.txt file
    - If the template project has a "build" folder, delete it before building.
    - Also copy the .vscode folder between projects if you want to re-copy this again.

Organization:
    - /src: main c++ files
    - /include: header files

### Manual Way
1. Open VS Code
2. Click the dropdown arrow by the terminal, select "Command Prompt"
3. Type "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" into cmd
4. To compile code "cl main.cpp" to run it "main.exe"

### CMake Way (Recommended)
1. Ensure the CMakeLists.txt is properly updated with a new project name
2. Type "cmake -S . -B build" into PS to configure the project
3. Type "cmake --build build" into PS to build the project
4. Type ".\build\Debug\project.exe" to run the project, make sure to change "project" to match txt

### Powershell Function (Simplest)
1. Type ".\run.ps1" in the terminal and it should accomplish everything from CMake
